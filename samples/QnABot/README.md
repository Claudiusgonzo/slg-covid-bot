# QnA Maker Bot Baseline

This baseline is integrated with the [Bot Framework v4](https://dev.botframework.com) and uses the [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai) service.  It was created by exporting the bot code from the Azure Portal for a bot that was created by the QnA Maker service when you click the "Create Bot" button on the QnA Maker publishing page.  A number of commonly requested extensions where added to the basic bot that the QnA Maker service created to form a QnA Maker baseline that has the following features:

## To try this sample

Steps:
1) Follow the step-by-step instructions here to create a QnA Maker knowledgebase and corresponding bot from the Publishing tab by clicking the "Create a bot" button
2) Go to the bot that was create and open the appsettings.json file in the Azure portal and copy its configuration and paste it into the appsettings.json file in this project
3) Create a Text Translation and Language Detection service and configure the corresponding configuration settings in appsettings.json for both services
4) Deploy the bot and browse to the Index page of the App Service that is hosting the bot to test the bot in a web chat control

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.3.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

# Deploy the bot to Azure
See [Deploy your C# bot to Azure][50] for instructions.

The deployment process assumes you have an account on Microsoft Azure and are able to log into the [Microsoft Azure Portal][60].

If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please refer to [Getting started with Azure][70] for guidance on how to get started on Azure.
