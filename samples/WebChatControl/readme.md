### Alternate Webchat Control Embedding
This shows how to add the bot webchat control to a page using HTML and Javascript.  This sample disables the file attachment button and ensures that the bot's welcome message is immediately shown upon loading of the webchat control. 

## To use
Place the sample HTML and Javascript into your website where you wish to host the bot.

## Setting options

* You must replace the `<Your bot secret here>` placeholder with your bot's secret.

* You may choose to have initials displayed in the chat window for the bot by enabling the botAvatarInitials in the styleOptions of the renderWebChat Javascript method.
